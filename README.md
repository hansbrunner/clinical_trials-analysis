# clinical_trials-analysis

This repository contains my explorations and analyses in clinical trial data science. The primary goal is to experiment with real-world 
clinical trial data and demonstrate the use of statistical techniques commonly used in the analysis of clinical trials.

## Project Folders

### 1. Veterans Lung Cancer Trial
In this project, I analyzed the **Veterans Administration Lung Cancer Trial** dataset using survival analysis techniques. The key methods 
applied include:
- **Kaplan-Meier curves**: To visualize survival probability over time for different groups.
- **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**: To assess the effect of various factors (such as age, cell type, and treatment) on survival.
- **Log-rank test**: To compare the survival distributions between different treatment groups.

The analysis highlights how clinical factors influence patient survival and serves as a foundational exploration of survival analysis in 
clinical trials.

## Methods Used
- **Survival Analysis**: A statistical approach to analyzing time-to-event data, commonly used in clinical trials.
- **Kaplan-Meier Curves**: Non-parametric plots to estimate survival probability over time for different groups.
- **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**: A regression model used to study the relationship between the time to event and covariates.
- **Log-Rank Test**: A statistical test used to compare the survival distributions between two or more groups.


## Future Work
More datasets and analyses will be added to this repository over time, focusing on different aspects of clinical trial data science.
